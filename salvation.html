      <blockquote>
        <p>"Indeed, all things We created with precise measure."</p>
        <cite>— Surah Al-Qamar 54:49</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This verse confirms that Allah (SWT) created the universe with exact balance and precision — the foundation of all mathematics. Nothing is random; everything is decreed.</p>

      <h3>Divine Equation of Salvation</h3>
      <pre><code>Salvation = (Faith × Righteous Deeds + Repentance)^∞ × Mercy_of_Allah</code></pre>
      <p>Faith and sincere deeds elevate your soul. Repentance clears your past errors. But none of this is enough without the infinite Mercy of Allah. As the Prophet ﷺ said: "No one enters Paradise by deeds alone — only by Allah's mercy."</p>

      <h3>Quranic Example: People of the Cave (Surah Al-Kahf)</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Indeed, they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance."</p>
        <cite>— Surah Al-Kahf 18:13</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>They chose belief over worldly gain and fled into a cave. Allah suspended time for them — defying nature's rules. A living example of divine control over space, decay, and time.</p>
      <pre><code>Guidance = Belief × Sacrifice × Patience + Trust_in_Allah → Miracle</code></pre>

      <h3>The Countdown: The Hour is Near</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has split."</p>
        <cite>— Surah Al-Qamar 54:1</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Time is finite. Every second reduces your balance. The final age is here. Don't be deceived by worldly distractions.</p>
      <pre><code>Time_remaining = Unknown - Current_Age</code></pre>
      <p>Only those who believe, do righteous deeds, and call to truth with patience will be saved. (Surah Al-Asr)</p>

      <h3>To the Disbelievers: A Logical Challenge</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Say: Bring your proof, if you are truthful."</p>
        <cite>— Surah Al-Baqarah 2:111</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>While some use science to deny, divine math exposes their flaws. The universe is too precise to be random. Every action, every atom, is recorded.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Balance in creation — Surah Ar-Rahman 55:7–9</li>
        <li>Deeds precisely recorded — Surah Al-Zalzalah</li>
        <li>Even an atom’s weight is counted — Surah Al-Anbiya 21:47</li>
      </ul>
